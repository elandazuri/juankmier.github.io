<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Someone once told me that insanity was doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result, I took that to heart and as a graphic designer my approach to design is anything but ordinary, 
I always try to break what is set as the standard, design for me is finding solutions to problematic visuals.
